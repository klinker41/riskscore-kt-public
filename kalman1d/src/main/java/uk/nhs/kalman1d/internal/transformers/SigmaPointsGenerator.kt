/**
 * SigmaPointsGenerator chooses a collection of points in the State space that represent the Guassian
 * distribution described by the current State.
 *
 * The Sigma points are chosen using Van der Merweâ€™s scaled Sigma point algorithm. This distributes the
 * Sigma points around the State's mean and at a distance proportional to the State's covariance.
 *
 * The idea is that after these points are projected forwards in time a new Gaussian can be
 * reconstructed from them as part of the Unscented transform.
 *
 * In our case the state, transition and observation dimensions are all equal to one so the
 * algorithm produces 7 points for of each type. NB: The duplication of points is necessary
 * due to how the mean and covariance weights are used to compute mean and covariance of the Sigma points.
